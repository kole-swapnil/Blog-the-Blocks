# BLOCKCHAIN 101


Just a chain of blocks. **No, it's much more** let's dive into blockchain to know about this technology.

## What is Blockchain?

>**Blockchain is a distributed ledger based technology which uses consensus based decisions to achieve trust in a peer-2-peer network among unknown peers.** 

*Didn't get all of that at once? You will get that soon.*

#### 1. Blocks in a blockchain
Blocks in blockchain hold batches of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree data structure. Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two.

#### 2. Chaining of Blocks
The linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block. Each block also has a timestamp and a nonce associated with it. Therefore all the data inside blockchain becomes immutable.

#### 3. Technologies involved in Blockchain
Blockchain involves three main technologies:

* Private Key Cryptography
	* Asymmetric Encryption : Generates a pair of key for an account namely a public key and a private key. Encrypt with public key and decrypt with private key and vice versa.

* Peer-2-Peer Network
	* Distributed ledger: No cenralized database everybody has a copy of all the data.
	* Majority: To make any changes/additions majority of votes is required.
* Blockchain Protocol
	* Hashing: Converting any type/form of data to a fixed length string[hash] depending on its content.


*Ethereum is same as Blockchain? Most people are still confused.* 

#### 4. Ethereum
Ethereum is an open software platform based on Blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. Ethereumâ€™s coding language solidity helps write smart contracts. Its native currency is eth. It was founded by Vitalik Buterin. 

*Contracts + Blockchain => Smart Contracts*

#### 5. Smart Contracts
A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.

*32 bit or 64 bit? Step into the Future with __256 bit__ machines.*

#### 6. Ethereum Virtual Machine
An Ethereum virtual machine provides a run anywhere obstruction layer for the smart contracts.EVMs are 256 bit machines having extensive power for performing mining. A smart contract written in HLL is translated into EVM bytecode and then deployed on EVM. Every node will host the smart contract codes on the EVM.

*~~Application~~ => Dapplication*

#### 7.Dapplication
A decentralized application is a computer application that runs on a distributed computing system. They have distributed ledger[DLT] based technology. It has a web-front and blockchain back-end and the smart contract connecting both. 

*What's your favourite coding language?*

#### 8.Solidity
Solidity is a contract oriented language. It is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It is statically typed language, supporting inheritance, libraries and complex userdefined types.

*So that was the __Beauty of Blockchain__ for you !!*
